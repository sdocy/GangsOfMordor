	Barad-dur, the great tower whence the Eye of Lord Sauron kept watch has fallen.<br/><br/>

	And from the west, reports of the unbelievable defeat of the massive horde<br/>
	sent to destroy Minis Tirith, the White City, have been received, amid tales<br/>
	of treacherous wizards and phantom armies.<br/><br/>

	The fate of Lord Sauron is as yet unknown, but the destruction of his mighty<br/>
	fortress, once thought untouchable, does not bode well.  Rumors of defeat, capture<br/>
	and worse have already spread across Mordor, creating a sea of confusion and chaos.<br/><br/>

	Many of those loyal to Sauron have already begun to desert their posts, slinking back<br/>
	to the dark holes they had inhabited before joining the service of the Great Eye.<br/><br/>

	Those who remain find themselves engaged in a vicious struggle to restore order.<br/>
	Opportunities for wealth and power abound for those with the strength and cunning to seize them.<br/><br/>

	A young orc captain, assigned to an all but forgotten outpost on Mordor's eastern border,<br/>
	finds himself faced with many difficult decisions as he attempts to make sense of the<br/>
	scarce news which arrives by scout and raven.<br/>
